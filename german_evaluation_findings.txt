General findings in german documents:
Questions are always based on the given text.
Correct Answer in base MCQ is 'B' or 'C' in like 90% of MCQs.
Answer options often come in some increasing order, meaning that one can consistently reproduce the original MCQ from the re-ordered versions.
MCQ with more than 5 options, tend to include very unrealistic options.
Could not spot a pattern in where in the text the necessary information to answer the question is located. (Not always at the end of page for example)


Mistakes found:
-Inaccuracy, but question is still correctly solvable: 
	Question asks about order to the hospital, but the text is actually about orders from the hospital.
	Page contains 2 big images and no usable text, thus a question is produced that has the solution within the question itself.
	Using different wording than in the document that allows for multiple interpretations	

-Multiple correct options:
	Text contains an or statement and both are given as options, so both are true.
	Text mentions that A is part of B, then lists both as answer options making both of them technically correct.

-Correct answer is wrong:
	Text mentions usual timewindow which is taken as correct answer, but the maximum timewindow is longer.
	Text requires an option to be there, but in the question it is changed to it being the only option making the correct answer false.
