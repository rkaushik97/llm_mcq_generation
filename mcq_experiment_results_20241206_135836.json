            "CoT": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step with reasoning based on the given text.\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The text begins by highlighting the challenges faced by Bolivian cities due to natural hazards and rapid urbanization. It then mentions the government's efforts to address these challenges.\n\n2. **Identifying the project's purpose**: The text explicitly states, \"To improve resilience of its cities, the government has identified key challenges needed to be addressed. Accordingly, the government is improving the policy frame and scaling up investment approaches and tools to increase resilience. The project Resilient Bolivian Cities will support the two municipalities of Santa Cruz and La Paz and the central Government in this quest.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - **a)** To develop a new economic policy for Bolivia: While improving the policy frame is mentioned, it's not the primary purpose but rather a part of the broader effort to increase resilience.\n   - **b)** To improve the resilience of Bolivian cities to natural hazards: This directly aligns with the stated purpose of addressing the challenges posed by natural hazards and improving resilience.\n   - **c)** To establish a new national park in Bolivia: The text does mention the Kantuntani Ecological Park, but this is a specific component within the broader project, not the primary purpose of the \"Resilient Bolivian Cities\" project.\n   - **d)** To promote tourism in Bolivian cities: There is no mention of promoting tourism as a goal of the project.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided in the text, the primary purpose of the \"Resilient Bolivian Cities\" project is to improve the resilience of Bolivian cities to natural hazards.\n\n**Answer: b)** To improve the resilience of Bolivian cities to natural hazards.",

            "CoT": "To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the text:\n\n1. The project \"Resilient Bolivian Cities\" is mentioned, and it's stated that SECO is financing it to the amount of 4.9 million Swiss francs.\n2. However, it's also mentioned that this project is \"part of a larger World Bank project with funding of US$ 75 million.\"\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the main source of funding for the entire \"Resilient Bolivian Cities\" project is not solely SECO, as it's only providing a portion of the funding (4.9 million Swiss francs). Similarly, it's not solely the World Bank, as the project is described as a \"larger World Bank project,\" implying that there may be other funding sources involved.\n\nAdditionally, there is no mention of the Government of Bolivia being a primary funding source for the project.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed \"None of the above,\" as the main source of funding for the entire project appears to be a combination of funding sources, rather than a single entity.\n\nWould you like me to help with creating another question?",
